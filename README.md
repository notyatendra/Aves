Hi, This is a simple implementation of creating an api which is capable of CRUD operations. Specifically for the application, I have implemented delete, create and read operation as it was only required. 

The basic entity used in the applicaition is Bird. The structure of which can be seen below:


name: String
family: String
continents: List<String>
added: String
visible: Boolean

I will add more information if I add some more things to the application.

peace.
